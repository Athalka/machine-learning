    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Developed by Friedman (https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/trebst.pdf) Gradient boosting improves upon decision trees and gives better prediction performance. Industry wide it is used mainly in regressiona and classification as well as web page ranking. Web search engines Yahoo and Yandex use variants of gradient boosting in their machine-learned ranking engines.(https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Learning_to_rank). Also in Kaggle multiple competitions have Gradient Boost model as the winning model (http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/01/23/a-kaggle-master-explains-gradient-boosting/). This model is also used to prefict firm failure rates in China (https://www.risk.net/journal-of-risk-model-validation/5277031/a-gradient-boosting-decision-tree-approach-for-firm-failure-prediction-an-empirical-model-evaluation-of-chinese-listed-companies)\n",

    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting improves upon and uses multiple decision tree models and their errors to minimize this overfit, and give respective value to more minor features or outliers in the data. It may be used to handle mixed data (as in our case, where boolearn, numerical and categorical values are present). A good trained and optimized Gradient boosting model may give better results from even Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "As an improvement upon decision tree Gradient Boosting algorithm may overfit data if care is not taken, learning rate and tree death optimization is a must for a good result. Due to sequential nature algorithm is hard to parallize making training time high.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",

    "To explain gradient boosting, and introduction to supervised learning and decision trees should be given.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict an outcome of and untrained (new) data, which priorly we had enough data classified, supervised machine learning is used. Several algorithms are used to train and predict data, one of them is decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree is a algorithm which provides a tree-like graph to model some decisions (features) and their possible consequences and finally the outcome result wanted. \n",
    "A simple model would be a decision to eat dinner outside given some features. Let our features be \"having money\" , \"weather condition\" and \"having a spouse\" . If we have money (having money = True) we check if we \"have a spouse\" . If we do have both check again if \"weather is good\". Finally if all these are True, we (or individidual) choose to eat outside. Having results of answers of some individiuals for these conditions (some may choose to go out even if they do not have a spouse), we train our model and a tree graph is born. Then for an unknown individual we try to predict (given feature values, like has money, weather good, does not have spouse) the outcome. This is decision-tree model, with more feature and data it may become complex to train and optimize such model so we use machine-learning algorithms to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models can be fitted to data individually within only one model like a decision tree, or combined individual models together to create a more powerful model which is called ensemble. Boosting is one method to create and ensemble. Gradient boosting algorithm is a derivative of decision tree, it is a chain of decision trees that all make a vote (multiple decision tree models). Each learning tree tries to improve a bit on the other trees in model, each new decision is influenced by other trees that have an opinion. Each addition tries to minimize its predecessors error, tries to correct \n",
    "where previous one failed to predict gradually, hence gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is relatively a strong model as since it is iterative \"learning\" model, it checks its mistakes (error reduction) then tries to improve itself. It can calculate importance (weight) of features relatively good (even minor ones) if enough optimization (which needs time and more processing power/memory) is done. Of course this is the weak side as having an optimized model will take slower time as multiple factors need to be optimized (tree length, learning rate etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our problem as we saw on the initial results Gradient boosting has a good accuracy and f-score. With some more optimization this model may give better performance.\n",
